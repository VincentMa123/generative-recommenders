# Tencent Advertising Algorithm Competition â€” Generative Recommender

## Project overview

This repository contains code and experiments for a generative sequential recommender built for the Tencent Advertising Algorithm Competition. This is a state-space model specifically for generative recommender trained on large-scale interaction data (~1M users, ~4M items). The implementation uses PyTorch, and NumPy, and follows a Hydra configuration-driven architecture inspired by the paper: https://arxiv.org/html/2504.07398v1.

The goal is to improve standard ranking metrics (HR@10, Recall@K) through feature engineering, architecture experiments (Hydra-style multi-branch generative encoder), negative sampling, and careful model fine-tuning.
